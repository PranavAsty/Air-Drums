# Air Drums

## Basic idea
Use the webcam to track the motion of color stickers attached at the end of drum sticks and map that to the drums in a virtual environment.

## How to run?
Use `python3 color_tracking.py` to run the two-drum demo of the project.

Use `python3 setLimits.py` to determine the low and high hsv limits for the color of the color sensor.
